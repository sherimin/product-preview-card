## Overview

### The challenge
This [product preview card component challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa/hub) is to build out this product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. The users will be able to view the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size, and see hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I strengthened my knowledge of text styling, with a focus on text decoration, line height, letter spacing, and word spacing: 

```
p {
    line-height: 23px;
    letter-spacing: 14;
    word-spacing: 1px;
}
```

```
.price-regular{
    text-decoration-line: line-through;
}
```
